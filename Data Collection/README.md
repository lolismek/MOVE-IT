This are the source codes for all the processes of data collection, as described in the paper.
- "batches.ino" is the arduino code, for our bracelets
- "main.py" is the pc code, for recieving and saving data from arduinos
- "intervale.py" is the auxiliary code used for marking relevant intervals of time
- "checker.py" checks fluctuations of the bracelets sending data (i.e. pauses too big between samples)
